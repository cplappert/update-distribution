.SH NAME
tcti-pcap \- Debugging module with pcapng output
.SH SYNOPSIS
A TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) module for logging the TPM
commands transmitted and received in pcapng format.
.SH DESCRIPTION
tcti-pcap is a library that logs TPM commands and responses and forwards them to
another TCTI module. The child TCTI module will be loaded by the tss2-tctildr
library. The config string passed to tcti-pcap specifies the child TCTI module
to be loaded. For instance, passing "pcap:device:/dev/tpm0" to tss2-tctildr will
result in tcti-pcap being loaded which will forward the TPM commands to the
tcti-device module.
The pcapng data is stored in a file tpm2_log.pcap. This path can be altered
using the environment variable TCTI_PCAP_FILE. The strings "stdout"/"-" and
"stderr" are valid values.
