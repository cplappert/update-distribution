.SH NAME
tcti-swtpm \- TPM simulator TCTI library
.SH SYNOPSIS
A TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) module for interaction with the
TPM2 software simulator.
.SH DESCRIPTION
tcti-swtpm is a library that abstracts the details of direct communication
with the interface and protocol exposed by the daemon hosting the TPM2
reference implementation. The interface exposed by this library is defined
in the \*(lqTSS System Level API and TPM Command Transmission Interface
Specification\*(rq specification.
.SH NOTES
It is best not to use the CUSE interface when setting up swtpm, but rather
to use the vtpm module proxy:
.EX
modprobe tpm_vtpm_proxy
swtpm chardev --vtpm-proxy --tpmstate dir=... --tpm2 ...
